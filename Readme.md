# This project is in development and if you do choose to make a game with it since there is no release version I would be more than happy to give you instructions on how to setup the files. You can email me at echothedeveloper@gmail.com

# If you do decide to use this and find that a certain feature you would like is not included you can email me echothedeveloper@gmail.com and since it is in earlly development I will add that feature to my list of features I am adding. If the feature is allready on my list then I will also tell you and if the feature is in the engine allready I will make it easier to find + update the documentation (I am still writing that as of now)

# Thank you for reading this far!
