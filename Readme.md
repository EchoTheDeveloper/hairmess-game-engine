# All files have been deleted | Massive Rewrite

I am making a massive rewrite in c++ as you read this. This will still use python and javascript for my game engine. This however will not use pygame but instead my own libraries made to use c++ SDL for speed. My friend @LocomotiveEnjoyer on github will be handling js development later on.

## Documentation will be released soon!
